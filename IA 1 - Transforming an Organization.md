### Assumptions
1. Build Deployment: Builds are done manually and deployment requires manual coordination between Development and Operations.
2. Testing: Testing is primarily manual done solely by the QA team. QA is the sole owner of product quality.
3. Infrastructure: It is managed manually or using scripts but no automation.
4. Communication: Relies on formal handoffs between departments, leading to delays, reduced big picture visibility and accountability and siloing.

### **Subject: Proposed Roadmap for Transitioning TechWave Solutions to a DevOps Model**

Hi Mr. Johannsen, I am very pleased to learn that you are eager to adopt DevOps principles at TechWave. I share your enthusiasm to improve our efficiency, product quality and inculcate the feeling of ownership in our teams. Here is an analysis and roadmap about we can go about adopting DevOps practices at our company -

**Background** - Currently, our software development teams such as Development, Testers, Operations, Client Services teams at TechWave work very much in silos. Each team has its own specific set of responsibilities and success criteria to track their performance, which are sometimes independent of success criteria of other departments. There have been cases where one team’s success hindered another team’s success which in the end did not translate to product success. To mitigate this, I propose the following roadmap towards DevOps culture.

1. **Introduction:** DevOps stands for a culture of shared ownership of product quality and reliability in software development teams. At a fundamental level, it denotes the philosophy of multiple specialties working together in tandem with shared responsibilities. It means bringing together development, operations, QA and business teams, aligning them towards common goals such as product quality and reliability. Essentially, it aims to shorten the SDLC and provide near continuous delivery of high quality software.
2. **Cultural Shift:** Traditionally, our software teams have worked in silos. Each team is used to working towards their team goals which are not always aligned with the wider “product goals”. With this legacy given, adopting DevOps is less about introducing new processes and team structures but more about a cultural and mindset shift. We must move away from our current "us vs them" mindset.
    - **Shared Responsibility:** Development, Operations, QA and Client Services must share ownership for the entire product lifecycle, from coding to deployment to testing the new improvements against client requirements and monitoring performance in production. Everyone in the team should be responsible for the quality and reliability of the service.
	- **Small Incremental Steps:** Software must be built not as a huge block of multiple improvements but more as a continuous integration, delivery and deployment of every meaningful small change in the product. This enables thorough testing and thereby improved quality, provides easy rollback if things go wrong and facilitates rapid customer feedback thereby enabling quick innovation.
3. **Team Structure:** Function based departments encourage siloed thinking and offer little avenues for cross communication and collaboration, which are critical for product success. Instead, DevOps culture encourages teams to be organized based on feature or product lines. That means, all the participants in a SDLC of a feature or a product should be part of a team. There can be shared resources between teams but the idea is to make each product team self-sufficient to build, deploy, and monitor the software by themselves. The combined team owns the whole application instead of teams owning certain portions of the SDLC. People will still have specialties, but the idea is to ensure that developers know a bit of operations and that operations engineers know something about quality assurance and so on, so that there develops a shared understanding of the nuances involved in full gamut of software development.
4.  **Tools and Technologies:** We will need to adopt new processes, tools and technologies to successfully complete the shift to DevOps culture. For example, Git for version control, Jenkins or GitLab CI for both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, Splunk for Monitoring, Docker for Containerization etc.
5. **Training and Skill Development:** Processes work only as long as the people follow them. Therefore, we need to prioritize investing in training, upskilling our employees and continuously checking our commitment to the DevOps culture. We may consider inviting industry veterans for in-house training or invest in online certification courses.
	- **Cross-Training:** Developers need to learn basic IaC and deployment concepts. Operations staff need to become familiar with application coding and testing principles. QA engineers must transition toward automated testing practices. Each team member should be a *jack of all trades and also master of one*.
	- **Upskilling:** The Operations staff must be upskilled in IaC, cloud infra management etc. They must become well-versed in using the tools and technologies that facilitate DevOps culture.
6. **Implementation Plan:** Neither Rome was built in a day nor change is easy. Rather than a drastic change one fine day, I would recommend following a DevOps-y way of adopting small meaningful changes in the way we work with minimal disruption to our clients. In each phase, we will measure key metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time for changes, uptime, production bugs count, CSAT etc for continuous improvement.
	- **Phase 1 (1st to 3rd month):** Begin by choosing a non-critical feature or product and forming the first cross-functional DevOps team. Adopt the required tools and technologies, the learning curve will be huge, mistakes will be made but these teething problems do happen. Document processes, measure and monitor progress - quality and throughput.
	- **Phase 2 (4-6th month):** Expand CI/CD and IaC to few more projects and bring more teams onboard. Establish best practices learnt the hard way from Phase 1. Many team members would have already got their hands dirty on the new tools and tech, marginal cost of learning would be decreasing.
	- **Phase 3 (6-9th month):** Establish DevOps culture company-wide. All software teams in this phase would be aligned along product and feature lines. We may still have central subject matter experts who would be defining the best practices in each function but most teams would be cross-functional. 

I believe this transition will position TechWave Solutions for significant growth and stability as it boosts our product quality and reliability, while requiring initial investment and a few hard decisions. I look forward to discussing this plan with you in detail when we meet next.

Best regards,  
Surya.
